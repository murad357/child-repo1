you should have 1 source repo 1 destination repo
and 1 repo used to run actions


first two should have 1 deploy key each 0 secrets
last repo should have 0 deploy key 2 secrets

and git-sync action is run on the last repo to sync repo 1 to repo 2

in summary, the source and destination repo will have deploy key with public key info (2 separate keys)
Third repo will hold the 2 secret keys. No deploy key.
